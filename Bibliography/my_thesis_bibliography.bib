  abstract={Teleoperated minimally invasive surgical robots can significantly enhance a surgeon's accuracy, dexterity and visualization. However, current commercially available systems do not include significant haptic (force and tactile) feedback to the operator. This paper describes experiments to characterize this problem, as well as several methods to provide haptic feedback in order to improve surgeon's performance. There exist a variety of sensing and control methods that enable haptic feedback, although a number of practical considerations, e.g. cost, complexity and biocompatibility, present significant challenges. The ability of teleoperated robot‐assisted surgical systems to measure and display haptic information leads to a number of additional exciting clinical and scientific opportunities, such as active operator assistance through ``virtual fixtures'' and the automatic acquisition of tissue properties.},

  abstract={During interaction with objects using a tool, we experience force and tactile feedback. One form of tactile feedback is local fingerpad skin deformation. In this paper, we provide haptic feedback to users of a teleoperation system through a skin deformation tactile feedback device. The device is able to provide tangential and normal skin deformation in a coupled manner, and is designed so that users can grasp it with a precision grip using multiple fingerpads. By applying skin deformation feedback on multiple fingerpads, the device is able to provide multi-degree-of-freedom interaction force direction and magnitude information to the user. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach for the performance of teleoperated manipulation tasks, we performed a study in which 20 participants used a teleoperation system to perform one of two manipulation tasks (peg transfer and tube connection) using force feedback, skin deformation feedback, and the combination of both feedback. Results showed that participants are able to use all feedback to improve task performance compared to the case without haptic feedback, although the degree of improvement depended on the nature of the task. The feedback also improved situation awareness, felt consistent with prior experience, and did not affect concentration on the task, as reported by participants.},

  abstract = {Context 
  With more complex kidney tumors treated by nephron-sparing surgery (NSS), complete tumor resection is becoming increasingly challenging. Intraoperative imaging may improve the establishment of negative surgical margins.
  Objective
  To discuss intraoperative imaging techniques that may help achieve complete tumor resection in NSS of renal tumors.
  Evidence acquisition
  PubMed was searched for English articles on intraoperative imaging during NSS of renal cell carcinoma published after 2005, and a reference search of retrieved articles was performed.
  Evidence synthesis
  Included studies reported about ultrasonography, fluorescence imaging, augmented reality, optical coherence tomography, and ex vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The number of patients included in these studies is limited, and randomized controlled trials have not been performed. Ultrasonography is a well-established technique to assess tumor localization and may be used to evaluate surgical margins of the resected specimen. Fluorescence imaging with indocyanine green may help differentiate tumor from normal kidney tissue. It is yet unclear whether fluorescence imaging can detect positive surgical margins. Augmented reality is best studied in robotic laparoscopic surgery, and may be useful for tumor localization and resection, if the problem of tissue deformation during surgery can be solved. More results have to be awaited about optical coherence tomography and ex vivo MRI.
  Conclusions
  Ultrasonography is a widely used technique to assist the surgeon in partial nephrectomy nowadays, while the use of fluorescence imaging and augmented reality is emerging. Although various techniques can be used during NSS, the added value of intraoperative imaging to support negative surgical margins remains to be demonstrated.
  Patient summary
  In this review, we discuss the value of various intraoperative imaging techniques that may help a urologist achieve complete tumor resection in nephron-sparing surgery for kidney tumors. Ultrasonography, fluorescence imaging, and augmented reality have been studied best, but their added value needs further investigation.}

  abstract = {Advances in the field of robotics have allowed modern technology to be integrated into medicine and that can minimize patients suffering from the side effects that are inherent to procedures for improving their quality of life. Conventional devices that are used for colonoscopies are rigid and require a high level of expertise from endoscopists to perform the procedure. Advances in robot-assisted colonoscopic systems now produce softer, more slender, automated designs that no longer require the operator to use forceful pushing to advance the colonoscope inside the colon, reducing risks to the patient of perforation and pain. It is challenging to reprocess these scopes for reuse as the materials used can be damaged during decontamination, leading to the possible risks of cross-infection by pathogenic microorganisms when reused by patients. An ideal solution is to eliminate these contamination risks to patients by adopting sterile, single-use scopes straight from the manufacturer's package to the patient. With this idea in mind, emerging developments that push the boundaries in this area will benefit patients and encourage the public to participate in and adhere better to colonoscopy screening to reduce the development of colorectal cancer. Thus, in light of these concerns and challenges, to encourage patients undergoing colorectal screening to comply with colonoscopy procedures that they are less invasive, changes in the design and materials are necessary. One of the more promising technological advances in this area is the advent of robotic colonoscopy.},
